  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The 'pluginClass' and Android 'package' identifiers should not ordinarily
  # be modified. They are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.
  #
  # NOTE: This new plugin description format is not supported on Flutter's
  # stable channel as of 1.9.1. A plugin published using this format will not
  # work for most clients until the next major stable release.
  # However, it is required in order to declare macOS support.
